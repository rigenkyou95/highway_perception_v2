TwinLiteNetPP (use_refine=True)
Finetune weight: twinlitenetpp_best_finetune.pth

Drivable mIoU: 0.5752
Lane     mIoU: 0.6018
Val subset: 500 samples (recommended next: full 10k)


On the BDD100K validation set (10,000 images, 640×360 resolution),
our TwinLiteNetPP (with refinement head and continuity loss) achieves:

- Drivable area segmentation: 57.53% mIoU
- Lane line segmentation:     60.90% mIoU

These results are obtained using our final fine-tuned weights
(twinlitenetpp_best_finetune.pth) and will be used as the geometry
stream backbone in the subsequent metric depth estimation experiments.
