# Mounting
height_m: 1.22

# Angles (deg)
# pitch: positive means camera looks DOWN (common road setup) — 明确你的定义
pitch_deg: 1.996
roll_deg: 1.146     # 你之前输出 mean=1.1458，可写 mean 或 median
yaw_deg: 0.631      # 你之前输出 mean=0.6314

# Rotation order (must be defined!)
# Example: R = Rz(yaw) * Ry(pitch) * Rx(roll)  (or your actual)
rotation_order: "yaw-pitch-roll"
rotation_convention: "R_world_to_cam"   # or "R_cam_to_world"

# Translation convention (optional)
# camera position in world frame, if you define world Z up and road plane Z=0:
t_world: [0.0, 0.0, 1.22]

# Notes for sign conventions
signs:
  pitch_positive: "down"
  roll_positive: "right_down"
  yaw_positive: "turn_right"
